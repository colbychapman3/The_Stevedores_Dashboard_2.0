# Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive design of the Stevedores Dashboard, a production-ready maritime management application that provides full offline functionality, robust data extraction capabilities, and intuitive user interface for managing ship information and analytics.

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Backend Flask Application:** Python-based web server with SQLite database
2. **Frontend PWA:** Progressive Web App with offline capabilities
3. **Service Worker:** Handles caching and offline functionality
4. **Widget System:** Modular, inter-communicating widgets for data display and interaction
5. **Data Extraction Wizard:** Robust processing system for ship information

## Offline Functionality Design

The following offline capabilities will be implemented:

1. **Service Worker Enhancement:** 
   - Cache-first strategy for static resources
   - Network-first strategy for dynamic data with fallback to cache
   - Background sync for data updates when connectivity is restored

2. **IndexedDB Integration:**
   - Local storage for ship data, user preferences, and application state
   - Queuing system for offline operations
   - Conflict resolution for data synchronization

3. **Progressive Web App Features:**
   - App manifest for installation
   - Offline page for when resources are unavailable
   - Push notifications for critical updates

## Widget Inter-Communication System

The widgets will communicate through:

1. **Event System:** Custom events for widget-to-widget communication
2. **Data Store:** Centralized data management with reactive updates
3. **State Management:** Consistent state across all widgets
4. **Real-time Updates:** Immediate reflection of changes across all components

## Data Extraction Wizard Enhancement

The wizard will be enhanced with:

1. **Robust File Processing:** Support for multiple file formats with error handling
2. **Data Validation:** Comprehensive validation of extracted ship information
3. **Progress Tracking:** Real-time progress indication with detailed feedback
4. **Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of extraction failures with retry mechanisms

## User Interface Design

1. **Maritime-Focused Design:** Professional interface tailored for maritime professionals
2. **Responsive Layout:** Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
3. **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 compliant for universal access
4. **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear information architecture with intuitive navigation

## Production Readiness

1. **Security:** Environment-based configuration, secure data handling
2. **Performance:** Optimized loading, efficient caching strategies
3. **Monitoring:** Comprehensive logging and error tracking
4. **Scalability:** Architecture designed for growth and high availability

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1:** Enhanced Service Worker and offline capabilities
2. **Phase 2:** Widget inter-communication system
3. **Phase 3:** Data extraction wizard improvements
4. **Phase 4:** UI/UX enhancements and production optimization
5. **Phase 5:** Comprehensive testing and deployment preparation

## Technical Considerations

- **Database Design:** Optimized SQLite schema for maritime data
- **API Design:** RESTful endpoints with proper error handling
- **Frontend Architecture:** Modular JavaScript with clean separation of concerns
- **Build Process:** Automated testing, linting, and deployment pipeline
