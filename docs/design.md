# Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive design of the Stevedores Dashboard, a production-ready maritime management application that provides full offline functionality, robust data extraction capabilities, and intuitive user interface for managing ship information and analytics.

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Backend Flask Application:** Python-based web server with SQLite database
2. **Frontend PWA:** Progressive Web App with offline capabilities
3. **Service Worker:** Handles caching and offline functionality
4. **Widget System:** Modular, inter-communicating widgets for data display and interaction
5. **Data Extraction Wizard:** Robust processing system for ship information

## Offline Functionality Design âœ… IMPLEMENTED

The following offline capabilities have been implemented:

1. **âœ… Service Worker Enhancement:** 
   - âœ… Cache-first strategy for static resources
   - âœ… Network-first strategy for dynamic data with fallback to cache
   - âœ… Background sync for data updates when connectivity is restored
   - âœ… Multi-layered caching (static, dynamic, API)
   - âœ… Comprehensive error handling and offline fallbacks

2. **âœ… Local Storage Integration:**
   - âœ… Local storage for ship data, user preferences, and application state
   - âœ… Operation queuing system for offline operations
   - âœ… Automatic conflict resolution for data synchronization
   - âœ… Comprehensive offline storage manager with retry logic

3. **âœ… Progressive Web App Features:**
   - âœ… Enhanced service worker with comprehensive caching
   - âœ… Offline indicators and user feedback
   - âœ… Automatic background sync when reconnected
   - ðŸ”„ App manifest for installation (basic implementation)
   - ðŸ”„ Push notifications for critical updates (planned)

## Widget Inter-Communication System

The widgets will communicate through:

1. **Event System:** Custom events for widget-to-widget communication
2. **Data Store:** Centralized data management with reactive updates
3. **State Management:** Consistent state across all widgets
4. **Real-time Updates:** Immediate reflection of changes across all components

## Data Extraction Wizard Enhancement âœ… PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

The wizard has been enhanced with:

1. **âœ… Robust File Processing:** Basic file processing with comprehensive error handling
2. **âœ… Data Validation:** Comprehensive validation of extracted ship information across all steps
3. **âœ… Progress Tracking:** Real-time validation feedback and form state management
4. **âœ… Error Recovery:** Graceful handling of validation failures with user-friendly notifications
5. **âœ… Auto-save Functionality:** Form data persistence during wizard navigation
6. **ðŸ”„ Multi-format Support:** Currently supports basic formats, can be expanded

## User Interface Design

1. **Maritime-Focused Design:** Professional interface tailored for maritime professionals
2. **Responsive Layout:** Works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
3. **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 compliant for universal access
4. **Visual Hierarchy:** Clear information architecture with intuitive navigation

## Production Readiness

1. **Security:** Environment-based configuration, secure data handling
2. **Performance:** Optimized loading, efficient caching strategies
3. **Monitoring:** Comprehensive logging and error tracking
4. **Scalability:** Architecture designed for growth and high availability

## Implementation Plan

2. **ðŸ”„ Phase 2 PARTIAL:** Widget inter-communication system
   - âœ… Chart integration for real-time data visualization
   - âœ… Basic widget communication through shared data
   - ðŸ”„ Enhanced event system for widget-to-widget communication

3. **âœ… Phase 3 COMPLETE:** Data extraction wizard improvements
   - âœ… Comprehensive form validation
   - âœ… Error handling and user notifications
   - âœ… Auto-save functionality
   - âœ… Progress tracking and feedback

4. **ðŸ”„ Phase 4 ONGOING:** UI/UX enhancements and production optimization
   - âœ… Enhanced error handling and notifications
   - âœ… Chart.js integration for data visualization
   - ðŸ”„ Advanced PWA features
   - ðŸ”„ Production deployment optimization

5. **ðŸ”„ Phase 5 PENDING:** Comprehensive testing and deployment preparation
   - ðŸ”„ Testing suite implementation
