2.  The data extraction wizard provides accurate, robust processing of ship information
3.  Widgets on ship-info pages are fully editable with working submit buttons
4.  All widgets communicate with each other to ensure data consistency across analytics
5.  The interface provides visually stunning, intuitive navigation for maritime professionals
6.  Data synchronizes seamlessly when connectivity is restored

**User Experience Goals:**

*   Seamless offline-first experience with no functionality loss
*   Intuitive, maritime-focused interface design
*   Fast, accurate data extraction capabilities
*   Real-time widget inter-communication and data consistency
