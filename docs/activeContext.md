# Active Context

**Current Work Focus:**

The core offline functionality has been successfully implemented. The application now works fully offline with comprehensive caching, operation queuing, and automatic sync. Focus is now on remaining enhancements for production optimization and advanced features.

**Recent Changes:**

*   **COMPLETED:** Comprehensive offline functionality implementation
*   **IMPLEMENTED:** Enhanced service worker with multi-layered caching strategies
*   **CREATED:** Offline storage manager with operation queuing and automatic sync
*   **INTEGRATED:** Chart.js for real-time data visualization (progress and vehicle distribution charts)
*   **ENHANCED:** Form validation across all wizard steps with comprehensive error checking
*   **IMPROVED:** Error handling with user-friendly notifications and offline indicators
*   **UPDATED:** Master dashboard with offline-first data loading and chart integration
*   **ENHANCED:** Ship info dashboard with cached data fallbacks and offline functionality
*   **ADDED:** Automatic background sync when reconnected to internet
*   **IMPLEMENTED:** User feedback system for offline/online status changes
*   **COMPLETED:** Project structure cleanup and organization
*   **REMOVED:** `.vscode/` folder containing unrelated taskmaster-ai configuration
*   **CLEANED:** `package.json` - removed taskmaster dependencies, updated project name to "stevedores-dashboard"
*   **REGENERATED:** `package-lock.json` to match cleaned package.json
*   **VERIFIED:** All files now belong specifically to Stevedores Dashboard project
*   **CONFIRMED:** SQLite database structure and purpose for maritime operations data
*   Created complete memory bank documentation (9 files)
*   Migrated ship data from JSON file to SQLite database
*   Externalized JavaScript from HTML files

**Next Steps:**

*   **COMPLETED:** Enhanced widget inter-communication system for better data flow between dashboard components
*   Implement advanced PWA features (push notifications, enhanced manifest)
*   Optimize production deployment configuration and security hardening
*   Implement comprehensive testing suite with high coverage
*   Performance optimization and bundle size reduction
*   Complete user and developer documentation
*   Final production readiness review and deployment preparation

**Current Focus:** Final 5% completion as outlined in `completion-plan.md`
