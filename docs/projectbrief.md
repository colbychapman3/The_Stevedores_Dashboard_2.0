*   Backend refactoring and database migration from JSON to SQLite
*   Frontend refactoring to remove redundant code and hardcoded values
*   Implementation of robust offline-first PWA functionality
*   Enhanced service worker with proper caching strategies
*   Offline data synchronization using IndexedDB
*   UI/UX improvements and widget enhancement
*   Comprehensive testing and production readiness review

**Critical Success Factors:**

*   Application must be fully functional offline
*   Data extraction must be accurate and robust
*   Widgets must communicate effectively to maintain data integrity
*   Interface must be visually appealing and user-friendly
*   Code must be production-ready with no blocking issues
