# Progress

**What Works:**

*   **COMPLETED:** Complete memory bank documentation (9 files):
    *   `projectbrief.md`
    *   `productContext.md`
    *   `systemPatterns.md`
    *   `techContext.md`
    *   `activeContext.md`
    *   `progress.md`
    *   `design.md`
    *   `researchstack.md`
    *   `README.md`
*   **COMPLETED:** Project structure cleanup and organization
*   **COMPLETED:** Backend database migration from JSON to SQLite
*   **COMPLETED:** JavaScript externalization from HTML files
*   **COMPLETED:** Package configuration cleanup (removed taskmaster dependencies)
*   **VERIFIED:** SQLite database structure for comprehensive maritime operations data
*   Basic Flask application structure in place
*   Ship model and routes implemented
*   Data migration script created

**What's Left to Build:**

*   Frontend refactoring (remove redundant code, hardcoded values)
*   Widget inter-communication implementation
*   Robust offline functionality (enhanced service worker)
*   Offline data synchronization using IndexedDB
*   UI/UX improvements and widget enhancement
*   Data extraction wizard improvements
*   Production readiness review and testing

**Current Status:**

*   ‚úÖ **Memory bank setup complete**
*   ‚úÖ **Project structure clean and organized**
*   ‚úÖ **Backend refactoring complete**
*   üîÑ **Frontend refactoring** - ready to begin
*   ‚ùå **Offline functionality** - not yet implemented
*   ‚ùå **Widget communication** - not yet implemented

**Known Issues:**

*   Application does not work offline yet (critical for maritime use)
*   Data extraction wizard may not be robust
*   Widgets in ship-info pages may not have working submit buttons
*   Widget inter-communication not implemented
*   Production readiness concerns not addressed

**Evolution of Project Decisions:**

*   ‚úÖ **Completed:** Migration from JSON to SQLite database for better data integrity
*   ‚úÖ **Completed:** Externalized JavaScript from HTML files for better code organization
*   ‚úÖ **Completed:** Project structure cleanup to remove unrelated files and dependencies
*   **Ongoing:** Focus on offline-first PWA architecture for maritime environments
*   **Planned:** Widget-based modular architecture for better maintainability and inter-communication
